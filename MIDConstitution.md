## Article I: Name of Organization
The name of this organization shall be the **Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club** (henceforth **MID**).

## Article II: Statement of Purpose
 The aim of MID shall be to transliterate and analyze historical primary source documents. MID strives for undergraduate inclusion in research normally reserved for the graduate level. 

## Article III: Membership

### §1: Membership Qualifications
There are no specific qualifications for membership other than interest to participate and good standing with MID (see *Article III, §4*).

### §2: Membership Recognition
In order to be a recognized member of the club, a student must attend the College of the Holy Cross.

### §3: Membership Rights and Privileges
A student in MID may be granted access to Classics Department resources related to MID, such as technology, events, meetings, and travel opportunities.

### §4: Procedure for Member Discipline or Expulsion
A member may be expelled from MID for impeding MID's proceedings, repeatedly engaging in destructive, vandalistic, disrespectful, belligerent, or bullying behavior, for violating the College's policies, or for neglecting security procedures. The Executive Board must first issue a written warning to the member by simple majority vote; for expulsion proceedings to continue, the member in question must continue to engage in problematic behavior despite the written warning. A vote of expulsion requires a two-week notice to all MID members, a two-thirds majority vote of the Executive Board, and the consent of the Faculty Advisor. The expelled party loses membership in MID, and thus the Membership Rights and Privileges (see *Article III, §3*). The decision may be appealed to the Faculty Advisor; the expelled party may be reinstated to full Membership and Membership Rights and Privileges by a two-thirds majority vote of the Executive Board and the recommendation of the Faculty Advisor.

If the continued safety of the members of Parnassus would be threatened by continued contact with another member, the Executive Board may bypass the written warning, with the consent of the Faculty Advisor, and proceed directly to expulsion procedures.
